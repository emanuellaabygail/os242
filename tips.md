# TIPS
1. **Check and Recheck Everything**: Most of the assigments in this course are easily done by copy and pasting commands and instructions, but don't be fooled because some of them have tricky stuffs that you have to be careful with. Make sure to read the full instruction of each assignment to ensure you have done the assignment correctly.
2. **Pay Attention in Class**: It may be boring, but believe me, you will learn so many new and interesting things if you pay attention in class.
3. **Don't Believe ChatGPT**: You may come accross an error while doing the assignments and your instinct might tell you to ask GPT on how to solve the error. Sometimes ChatGPT (or other AI chatbots) might give you the wrong answers and following its instruction might make the matter worse. If you are unsure about anything, go ahead and ask the lecturer(s). They are surely kind enough to help you solve the problem.
4. **Don't EVER Forget `myupdate.txt`**: From week 2, you would have to update a file called `myupdate.txt` in your GitHub repo. This file is very crucial for the scoring of each week. **NEVER** forget to update it. **EVER**.
5. **Learn From Your Mistake**: In OS, your final score of the course is the accumulation of each week's score. To avoid making the same mistake as before, you can check the detail of your score by accessing your tarball. It is really helpful to troubleshoot each mistake we make so we don't repeat it in the next week!

~ good luck! ~
